The local outlier factor is an algorithm proposed by Markus M. Breunig, Hans-
Peter Kriegel, Raymond T. Ng and JÃ¶rg Sander in 2000 for finding anomalous data
points by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to
is neighbors.

The algorithm starts with a constant k and a set of objects with a distance
function. At first the distance to the k-th nearest neighbor will be determined
for every object A ( k-distance(A) ), as well as a set of objects containing all
objects within the k-distance of an object ( Nk(A) ).

The next step is to calculate the local reachability density (lrd) for every
object, wich is the inverse of the average reachability distance of an object
from its neighbors, wich can be infinite at duplicate points.

Afterwards the local reachability densities will be compared with those of the
neighbors, which is the average local reachability density of the neighbors
divided by the objects own local reachability density. A value near 1 indicates
that the object comparable to its neighbors, a value below 1 indicates a denser
region, while values significantly larger than 1 indicate outliers.
