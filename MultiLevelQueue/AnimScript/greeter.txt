A Multi Level Queue for scheduling uses a predefined number of levels to
schedule processes. Processes get assigned to a particular level at insert.
The processes in queues of higher level will then be executed first, lower level
queues will be executed when all higher level queues are empty. Each queue is
free to use its own scheduling, thus adding greater flexibility then merely
having multiple levels in a queue.

In this scenario each process has a tima of arrival (process.time), and a number
of execution timeslides (process.work). The algorithm loops until all processes
are done. To schedule the processes the algorithm first adds all arriving
processes to the queues, then picks the non-empty queue with the highest level
and executes the upcoming process.

The first queue in this example uses First-Come-First-Serve-Scheduling while the
second queue uses Round-Robin-Scheduling.
